    m_Localized: "I\u2019ve heard that Quenouille came here often, you should be
      careful around him. He likes creating himself a fantasy life with his castle,
      servants and everything. Ugh, what a liar."

    m_Localized: In the greek mythology, Prometheus gave the fire to the primordial
      animals. Do you think something of the sort really happened? Or do you think
      something different?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 3582608486469677
    m_Localized: That is just some fantasy story written in ancient Greece. Mythology
      is a very well-written fiction, at least to me, but that is all it is, nothing,
      or pratically nothing was taken from reality -

    m_Localized: "I understand that it\u2019s hard to get how we managed, all of
      a sudden, to acquire the power to create fire, but maybe it was some genius
      who found out about it? We can make miracles too +"
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 3582608486469679
    m_Localized: Yes, I think something of the sort might have happened! I wonder
      how or why, but I think it is still a possibility +

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 3582608486469680
    m_Localized: Sure, but fiction always has a part of truth, and I think it is
      a good way of explaining it, wether it really happened, or not.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 3582608486469681
    m_Localized: "Yes, it\u2019s a possibility, but miracles always happen by accident,
      so.. I think it was more of an accident than anything else, really."

    m_Localized: "There\u2019s always a possibility, but there\u2019s also a possiblity,
      even greater, that it didn\u2019t happen. We can only speculate with no strong
      evidence of this event."
