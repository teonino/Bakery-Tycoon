    m_Localized: I bought some new furniture for my mansion recently, those were
      quite expensive for what they were at first, but I could negociate with the
      seller, one cent at a time! Ha, I was utterly proud of that one. If you could
      add piece of furniture to your bakery, what would you get?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: What about.. a bookshelf!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 3583467668672512
    m_Localized: Carpets are common and boring! Also, one is enough, but you can
      put many things on walls and against them, instead of focusing on your floor.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 3583467668672513
    m_Localized: Original, cute and funny! Yes, why not? That sure fits the vibe,
      in my humble opinion.

      not interested in my offer."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 3583467668672529
    m_Localized: "Today\u2019s architecture is rather.. distasteful, it lacks some
      kind of.. aesthetic, everything is made to be reusable and lacking in beauty."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 3583467668672530
    m_Localized: "It sure isn\u2019t as pretty as before most of the time, but there
      are still a lot to appreciate in today\u2019s architecture, it\u2019s very
      different from before though"
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 3583467668672531
    m_Localized: I feel you, I just think older architecture was way more imposing,
      huge, and have a lot more work put into it, but people took more their time,
      too
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 3583467668672532
    m_Localized: " I just think you don\u2019t like it, but if there is so much,
      then it means they are more popular and easy to do, so this style of architecture
      is more suited for today\u2019s society"
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 3583467668672533
    m_Localized: "I think this is just a question of point of view. I don\u2019t
      think we\u2019re on the same side on this issue."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 3583467668672534
    m_Localized: Right? As society changed, so did architecture, all people live
      faster, eat faster, work faster, and as a result, exhaust themselves faster.
      Architecture is now mostly industrialized except when it comes to grand monuments.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 3583467668672535
    m_Localized: "Yes, I totally agree, it\u2019s just a shame that it has become
      so rare to see really beautiful architecture."

    m_Localized: "Yes, I\u2019ve heard of it! It was a legend we all told to others
